# WildFind

## Get to know us 

As a passionate web developer I love to combine fun with learning through interactive, user-driven experiences. This project showcases how data doesn‚Äôt have to be static ‚Äî it can be explored, played with, and discovered.

My aim is to create a site that‚Äôs engaging for users of all ages, while also presenting meaningful information about the natural world. Whether you're here to test your skills, learn about wildlife, or just enjoy a beautifully crafted hidden objects safari game, I hope this experience brings you something new.

This project was built as part of my journey in learning and applying front-end technologies, and it reflects the following values:

üìä Interactive data presentation

üåø Environmental awareness

üéÆ User-centered design

üí° Creative learning experiences

Thanks for exploring with me ‚Äî and happy finding! ü¶Åü¶ìü¶í

## Building process

I started building my project by creating the structure tree. I then concentrated on the game-area images, which represent the background of the game. I chose to have two themes and challenges. The first theme is **The Big Five** - featuring the African Elephant, African Lion, African Leopard, African Buffalo and the Black Rhinoceros. These animals are five of the most iconic and sought-after animals to see on an African safari. The second theme is **Rainforest Creatures** - featuring the Tree Frog, Blue Morpho Butterfly, Boa Constrictor, Orchid and the Capuchin Monkey. These animals are ideal for learning about tropical ecosystems.

I then proceeded to hide the animals in the two backgrounds. I started with the blue morpho butterfly. I used a "hidden-object" class, and used the pointer value for the cursor attribute in css to change the cursor to a little hand pointing when the user hovers over a hidden object. I used jQuery to make a pop-up appear (alert() funtion) once a hidden object it's clicked and make it disspear after it is clicked.

I continued by adding all the hidden animals/plants to the Rainforest challenge. Once the hidden objects were in and the basic functionality of the game was working (finding object, clicking object, pop-up, object disappears and the word is crossed), I wanted to make the pop-up more interesting by adding a picture of the object, as well as some information. After researching I discovered that the alert() function, which I initially used for the pop-up, has limited functionality and I discovered a modal was more adequate for my needs. Moreover, I realised that I only used jQuery in my project and I needed to use JavaScript as well. Therefore, I proceeded to implement the above changes by using a modal as shown on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp).

I first added the modal in the HTML file and I then styled it in the css file using mostly info from the above link from W3Schools. I then proceeded to write the JavaScript array, containing the animals/plants with their properties. Finally, I wrote the code to hide the object once it is clicked, to cross the matching name in the footer checklist and to show the modal pop-up with the info about the object. Once this was done I proceeded with writing the code for closing the modal. For this I thought two options would work: an x in the top right corner and clicking the background.

I then worked on the accesibility of the page, such as the text readability using the [ACCESSIBLEWEB checker](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/). 

At this point, I needed to add a counter for the found items, which I did and I corrected the background photo to make sure it doesn't scroll. 

Further, I added a pop up message as well for when all the hidden objects are found. Finally I changed the alert() function with a modal to present the congratulations message at the end of the game in a better way.

I then concentrated on improving the responsiveness of the game. Once i managed to make the background picture show fully in all screen sizes, I started working on the footer. To make it responsive in all sizes and orientations I used different CSS stylings and I used JavaScript to move the counter from the game-area to the footer in portrait mode. In landscape mode I hid the footer and added a button to toggle it (make it appear to see the items that need to be found and dissapear to allow use better view of the background) using JavaScript as well.

## Troubleshooting
1. The first issue I encountered was the crossing of the words, once the hidden object is found. Initially it didn't work because I did not wrapped it in the $(document).ready(...) function, to ensure it runs after the page is loaded (i.e. the HTML document has been fully loaded).

2. The second issue I encounter, is again the crossing of the word once the hidden object is found. step one worked initially because I didn't have an icon next to the word. After adding the icons I noticed the crossing was not working anymore. Therefore, I assumed it will be the img tag that interferes with the crossing and I enclosed the text in a span tag. This helped resolve the issue.

3. I initially used jQuery to make a pop-up appear when the object was found. I then realised that the project requries JavaScript and I decided to change the code to JavaScript. After researching I realised that the alert() function was not a good idea, because it has limited functionality. Therefore, I proceeded to use a modal.

4. Initially, I declared the hiddenObjects array inside the DOMContentLoaded event listener, so it wasn't accessible outside that function for the click handlers to use it - it was not lighting up in the js file and a message was saying that it wasn't used. As a result the pop-up didn't work. The solution was to move the array outside of the DOMContentLoaded callback, to be accesible everywhere.

5. After I created the pop-up and added all the necessary details, when I tested it was still not working. After several attempts to find the issue, I realised it was a typo: I wrote DOMContentLoade instead of DOMContentLoaded.

6. I then found an issue with the closing of the pop-up, which didn't work. After checking the console, I noticed I was getting an error (document.querySelector('.close-btn').addEventListener('click', function () {document.getElementById('infoModal').style.display = 'none';});). After investigating, the issue was resolved by putting the code inside the DOMContentLoaded event listener.

7. I used the [ACCESIBLEWEB](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/) to check the readability of the footer, as it seemed problematic. This was confirmed and I then changed the footer background color and the text color to ensure readability.

8. The background picture was not fitting inside of the screen and scrolling was needed. This, in my opinion, was not suitable for a game, therefore, I looked up solutions and I tried a couple options such as background-size: contain [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33578169/css-make-image-fit-screen-so-no-scroll-bars-appear), but this didn't work. Finally, I discovered the calc() function in CSS ([W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/func_calc.php)), which worked. Initially, this seemed to not do anything, however, after researching I discovered that the *-* needs space before and after ([stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30678942/does-calc-work-for-background-size-of-image-in-css)). 

9. I initially wrote a function updateCounter() to update the counter and I was calling this function inside the click event listener. I also put an alert (to show a congratulations message once all the hidden objects are found) inside this function. However, this was creating an unwanted behaviour: the congratulation message was showing before the final hidden object pop-up was showing and before the word was crossed. To resolve this, I've updated the function to just return the count and I changed the click event handler to save the count via the function updateCounter(). Finally, I moved the alert message inside the function for the closing of the pop-up with the hidden object info - button and background.

10. I've spent a good amount of time trying to resolve responsiveness issues. The background picture, was being cut and the hidden objects were moving accross the screen. After trying numerous methods to resolve this, I have finally managed to make it acceptable, by using aspect ration ([w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_pr_aspect-ratio.php)) and numerous media queries where I calculated the hight of the picture using the calc() function to account for the footer size. For mobiles I made sure the game is responsive in both landscape and landscape mode.

11. I encountered an issue where my counter was moving to the footer when resiing the screen down, however, when resizing back up the counter would not move back out of the footer. This happened because when the counter was moved to the footer, .footer-counter-placeholder was automatically becoming its parent, and it never returned to the .game-area. To ensure that the code puts it back there I've created a wrapper div .counter-holder for the counter and updates the moveCounter() function to use these fixed containers.
