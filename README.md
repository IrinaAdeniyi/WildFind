# WildFind

## Get to know us 

As passionate web developer I love to combine fun with learning through interactive, user-driven experiences. This project showcases how data doesn’t have to be static — it can be explored, played with, and discovered.

My aim is to create a site that’s engaging for users of all ages, while also presenting meaningful information about the natural world. Whether you're here to test your skills, learn about wildlife, or just enjoy a beautifully crafted hidden objects safari game, I hope this experience brings you something new.

This project was built as part of my journey in learning and applying front-end technologies, and it reflects the following values:

📊 Interactive data presentation

🌿 Environmental awareness

🎮 User-centered design

💡 Creative learning experiences

Thanks for exploring with me — and happy finding! 🦁🦓🦒
